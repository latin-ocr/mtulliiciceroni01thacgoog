PREFAOE.

Tan textos thie editionis thatof Zumpt, ee it is found in hie small·
er edition* varied in every few instancee on the authority of Beier,
Orelli, and Bonnell, and of Zumpt himself. The deviatione from
Zumpt’e text are generally, if not in every case, accounted for in the

, noces.

The notes are derived chiefly from the editione of Zumpt aud Bon·
nell,† which contain, besides their own, tho valuable remarks and exple·
natione of the Heusingsre and of Degen. Beier aud Gemhard have
aleo been frequently consulted, and especially the notes and treatieee
of Gerre, who discusses eo thoroughly, and iu eo lucid a manner, the
ideas contained in thie work of Cicero. There isan occasional refer-
ence also to the edition of Stnerenburg, to the German interpretation
and notes os Dr. A. W. Zumpt, and to the review of Bonnell in the
Neue Jahrbiicher, numbers 2 and 3, os the both volume. The render
hes been referred to Frennd's latin lexicon, without any citation of
the informatius required, became it is understood that an American
edition of that excellent work, prepared under the superintendence osa

'l'he present edition does not profess to coutain all the notes of the

. commentatore named above, who have labored on this work, nor indeed

the great body of them. Aa a general thing, all biogmphical and hie·
torical notes have been omitted. It was thought that learners in this

¹ country were so well supplied with books of reference, containing at

considerable length the information necessary for the elucidatlon of
the text, that it was better to allow them to consult their marruals
themselves, than to fnmieh them with explanatione necessarily more
