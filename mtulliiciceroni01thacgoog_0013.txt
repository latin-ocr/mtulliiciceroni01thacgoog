scanty. The example of tho German editors already named, and in·
deed cf almost ell German commentatore, ean, it is true, be quoted for
a different course. But it should be borno in mind that they prepare
their works for those who are not supplied with these books cf refer-
ence. A German commentary is a transcript of the instructions cf the
class-roem, where cral teaching takes the place of silent study, and, tn
agreat extent, supplies the want of manuale. Such a commentary
therefore contains all the explanations which its author has been ac·
customed to give tc his class; not only grammatioal and critical com·
ments, but those slso which pertain to geography, history, biography,
and antiquities. lt should be ohserved, however, that German pupils
do not, us a general rule, make use cf such commentarios, but ef the
unadorned text of the authors they study. In this edition, a few notes
of the historioal class spoken of bave been introduced, in cases where
the dictionaries in common use have not been found to contaiu the de-
sired information.

The general design cf the brief commentary is two-sold: first, to
aid the learner in understauding the contente of the treatise‚ the
thoughts end connectione of thought of the author3 and second, to
explain grammatioel difficulties, and especially tc inculcetea know-
ledge of grammatica] principles The editor has aimed throughout to
gulde rather than carry the learner through difficulties, requiring of
him more study'in consequence cf his help, than he would probably
have devoted to the book without it There will be found frequent
references to the grammars where there is no difficulty in translating
and understanding the author, and thet for the mere purpose of in-
forming or reminding the leamer of some law of the languege. To
some these references will undoubtedly seem too numerous. They
will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity tc ex·
ercisc his own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this objectiou, and in the preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought tc prevail. But yet, considering
the attainments of the great body of studente who would be likely to
read this book; would not more on the whole be gained by a multipli-
cation of references than by their omission? Besides, numerous as
they are, they dc not comprise all that are inserted by Zumpt himself
in his edition, not a few having been omitted, as unnecessarily directing
the attention of tholearner to principles, with which, it might be taken
for granted, that he was already sufficiently familiar. On this point,
therefore,tbc error,if there is one, is pmbably on the side of scantinsss.
