lle had sent hini to Athens ιο pnrsnc the study of philosophy under
Cratippus; but moved by some nnfavomhle reports respecting his con-
duct there, he had determined ιο visit him. A etorm interrupted his

voyage soon atter he had weighed anchor, and drove him back to the ,

shore ol Italy, and news from Ronm prevented his setting sail again.
lle wrote this ιιοιιίοο, therefore, as a substitute lor the oral connscl
which he had intended to give. This fact-the fact that the work is
addressed by Cicero ιο his son-gives direction to the course of thought
contained in it It is not a code ol morale for mankind in geneal, bnt
it is particularly adapted ιο the circumstances of theson ol a distin·
gnished Romen statesman, who might bc expected ιο eecli distinction
in public life as his father had done. The book, therefore, does not
address ieelt to the middle and lower classes, except as the general

principles embodied and discussed in it are applicable to their condi- l

tion. 'l'he examples and illustratione are all drawn from the highest Τ
offiocs in the state and from the highest wallis of life. Thus the velue

of the treatise as a philosophical work is perhaps diminished by the ¹
contractiori of its scope, while the interest in it is increased hythe fre·
quent display of parental regard.
