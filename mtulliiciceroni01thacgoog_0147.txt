here to aid those who are not familiar with the doctrines of the Stoical
philosophy, in understanding the somewhat obscure sentences in this sectiou.

'lhe Stoic believes that nothing can be a good forman which does not
pertain to himself ; that heis therefore only ooncemed to know what his

nature is, and then to perfect it All men indeed unconscionsly make it
their ultimate aim to bring themselves nearer to perfection. But the wisa
man, becoming consciens of this ultimate sim, leaves the indirect paths by
which the artificial motives and social prejudices and passions of men seek
for happiness, and shepes his course directly towards this goat

Nothing, at the first glauce, appears more absurd in the system of the
Stoica than this: that they, who consider virtue the only good, set down all
the duties of which Cicero treats in this book among things indifferent-
things which, like riches aud honor, are neither good nor bad-which deservo
some preference to be sure, but never further the true happiness of man.

But this system finds a parallel in the creed of theologiam, who consider
sinful the virtuosos the heathen, aud account every performance of duty,
which does not spring from Christian motives, better indeed than the neg-
lect os the same, but insufficient to make man acceptabis to his Mulier or
blessed in himself Now to the Christian of these theologiam corresponds
the wlse man of the Stoics. 'l'he virtues of the heathen and the unconverted
are their medic officio-acts by which external good is secured and evil
avoided, but which nevertheless give no sign of true, internal, moral good-
ness. The virtues of the Christian, the acts of the completely reformed, or
rather, the completely developed—the altogether perfect man-are the
efficia ecta.

mmm of this is, tliat msn's acts hold 'a twofold relation; one
to the beart and spirit of the man, from which they spring, the other to
· the effeots which they came in the world Perfection--the true good, lies
only in man, in his inner, spiritual nature, in his formes, his inclinations.
External acts therefore can be good or bad only in the first of the two rela-
tions mentioned above-they can share in perfectiori only so far as they
arethe outbreaks of the soul's excellence. ι

In the second relation, that is, in relation to the outward aims and oon-
requences, each act can have only that degree of value or worthlcssncss
which the things themselves have, of which it is the cause. if I allevinte
the pain of a sufferer, or relieve the want of a poor man, the act can be
estimated uo higher than the health which I restore, or the want which I
have satisfied But iuasmuch as these things, according to the system of
'the Stoice, are neither good nor evii, that act itself, estimated only in view
of its effeots, can be called neither good nor evil It has certainly a value,
because health aud sustenance are valuable; but this valueis only so great

that there arises s difference between it and its opposite, in aeonrdanoo
with which choice must be made, in case of a choico, but not so great that
