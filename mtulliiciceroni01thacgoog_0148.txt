being have certain tendencies. If this nature exist 10110 entire complete·
ness and extent, if all these tendencies are fully 0011111011, then the man 10
virtuous. All that such a man does 10 good, is sareptcpa,is perfect duty.
It may perhaps, in the eyes of the whole world, not be different from 11101
which the ordinary, or even the bed man does3 it may perhaps, in relation
10 the good 01 society, be of equel value, but within it hes 0 spirit altogether
different—a different power. The one man worlis always with all the
iacultics of a perfect soul, and 111000 1110011100 10 mutual uuion and in har·
mony. The etheris, so to speah, called out and dctermined only 1)] the
occasion. True virtue is en ever-burning fire, which produces cf itself light
and heat The virtue of the imperfect man is 0 light lrindled for 1110 00-

An act may be adapted 10 circumstances and setisfy some visible rela-
110110. It may benefit 1000] and hann no one. And then the great portion
of mankind call it upright and ask nothing more. But the sharper eye 01 the
philosopher searches deeper. lt sees a great difference between the man-
ner in which this 001 10 performed by the wisc man, on the one hand, and
by the common man on the other-by him whose characteris thoroughly
and always upright, and by him who determines 10 do n'ght this time in
view only 01 motivas derived from present circumstances. From this comcs
the Greek name given hythe Stoics to such a duty, and their definition
which Cicero here introduces. They cell such a duty καθῆκον, tire 10110-
110110 fitiinp, and define it as 00 act for which rational grounds can he
given

The reflecting 1001101 will be struck by this, 0011 ask: Oen there be a
higher goodness 01 actions, than that 01 having performed thern according
to reasonl “Certainly not,'' would the Stoic enswer, “if it were the com·

duties commonly required 0011 performed in human life, are cltoyether in
