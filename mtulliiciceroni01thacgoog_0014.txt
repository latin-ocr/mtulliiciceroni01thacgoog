not thus referred, there are two classes. urst, those which are ccm-
men to several different editions and are uncredited in all, and may
therefore be considered common property3 second, those which have
been added by the American editor. illest ef tbe derived notes, besides
being translated, bave been very much changed in their form, by being
abridged, condensed, and otherwise modified3 and in some cases so
much so, that it seemed hardly fair teimpute the note in its new abape
te its real author. Some commenta, therefore, will appear to ba claim·
ed for this edition as original, which, by suggestion at least, are due to
another. But it will be very easy for any one, who bae the audiere
enumerated in the beginning of this pressae, to see for himself to what
extent the notes are derived from others. A slight comparisen will
show that tbe present editor hes had little to do, but to use bis judg·
ment, in selecting from the abundant materiale furnished by able schol·

No part of the writings of Cicero hes been mere fortunate than the
De Officiis in respect to the preservation and perfecting of ite text, nor
will it suffer in comparison with any in regard to the abilitywith which
its text has been illustrated and explained. If the bools,now‚ not with·
out diffidence, presented to the public, shall have contributed any thing
to make the valuable labore of others more extensively available, its
object will bave been accomplished. It hasbeen prepared in the midst
of other dudae, and retarded in its preparation by the repeated and pro-
tracted illnass of ita editor, and might put in a plea for tbe indulgence
which it will doubtless need. ’

la the first chapter of the second boolr, Cicero expresses the appre-
hension‚ that some good men may find fault with his devotion to philes-
epby. He vindicates himself, however, by saying that be can no
longer benefit the commonwealth by bis care and counsele, inasmucb
aa it is now under the tyrannical control of ene man. He must,
therefore, give his activity a new direction. To yield to patriotic grief,
in view os tbe sad change in the state, would soon exhaust and proe-
trate him. Te give himself up te pleasures, at such an emergency,
would be unworthy of a man of his cultivation. He turus, therefore,
