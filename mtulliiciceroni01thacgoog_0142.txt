' Annum jam audientem] Cicero sent his son 12 Athens about the first
21 April, B. 0. 41, as we leam from a letter written by him 12 Atticus 1122
next year, (Ep ad Atticum XV. 1c,) in which, speaking 21 1212 son, 122 says:
scripsit, sibi, post Kal April—sie emim 22222222 ternpus confici—nihil da·
tum esse. As he says in the text that his son has been hearing Cratippus
2 year, it is inserted that Cicero began this treatise in the spring, or early
in the summer 44 R 0., two or three months at most 21122 1122 2222221222·
tion 21 Cesar.

On the other hand, the following reasons may be given 122 believing 11221
the 12221122 was not commenced 1111 1122 autumn 21 1122 same year: 1. In
the very frequent letters of this period, which give us almost the daily oc·
cupations of Cicero, there is no mention 21 2 work de Officiis till 021 14,
(sp. ad stt„ XV. 13.) 2. Cicero implies (de Off. 111 33) that this book
was intended as 2 substitute 122 1122 instruction which he had designsd
giving 1212 sou iu person at Atheus 11 may be supposed, therefore, that 11
was written 21122 1122 proieci 21 visiting Greece was abandoned. He in·
forms us (Ep. ad stt„ XVL ’1)11221 having set out on the voyage, he was
driven back 12 1122 vicinity ol Rhegium on the sixth of August, and was
induced 12 give up 1112 21211 12 his son, and return to Rome, hythe repre·
sentations 211212 friends that 2 1222221212 change in 22121122112122 had 1212222
place, and that his presence was demanded He reached the capital the
last day 21 August, and having, on the second ol September, delivered his
first Philippic, retired soon aiter 12 1212 country-seat Puteolanum Here hs
spent the mouths 21 October and November, and is supposed to have em·
ployed himself in writing this work Itis agreed that it was finished bs·
iore the ninth of December.

A„ W. Zumpt suggests that the disagreement here set forth may be
reconciled by suppos'mg 112211122 young Cicero, although he 1211 home the
first 21 April, did not 122 some time actually commoneo his attendsncc
