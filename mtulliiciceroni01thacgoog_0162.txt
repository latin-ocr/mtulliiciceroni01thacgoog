d. Intelliyewdwm est] “Although intelligendum ert often occurs in this
work in the sense oi intelligitur or facile potest intellipt, still it implica, at
the same time, that itis proper or becoming to see or understand'' Ζ Gr.
ξ eth—Honestate] differs hom honestum oi the preceding sentence as the
abstraot differs from the concrete—Mancre] Z Gr. ἓ tlt—Aramo]
is not the ablativo of the volunt-ary agent

l. In prorupta] ct the tooyscde esd-282· qaid tole dici potest] ie. if the
case allows the use oi any such quotation-Illc vtrcyo otri] sc animum
gerit. Supposed to be a quotation from Ennius respecting Oloelia—-Et
siquid ςὶωπιοάι] sc dici potem—dalmaci . . . . scopator] Observe the
metaphorical use of the proper name—Dc spolia, «tc, surrender your
amor without a dneyyle aod rcithont hleodehed Bonnell, adopting the
explanationes Elvenich, (Progr. Breslsu, 1834) drops the comma after
apelia and makes aiae rudore ct conpatres attributive of spolia surrender
your encatlesa bloodlese anne, i. e the arms which you have refused to use
in battle

8. Quae . . .fcrttter perta eunt, ec laudamus] According to Madvig,

cratomn compes, per quem nisi libert et solati serantur, debilitatur oc sran-
yr'tor elaqueatis, Hinc, hence, i. e because we love to praise such deeds
-Htm noeto Cocles, hinc Decii . . . . clii] The elder Heusinger supplies
oscellum, anticipating it hom the next clause To this construction the
nephew obJects. He prefers to supply only the substantive verb, as in the
preceding sentence, hiae rhetorum, dcc With this construction, the connec-
tion οἰ thought would be: hence, (that is, because we bestow such praises
on breve exploits,) hence our Cocles, hence the Decii, dre, im without these
praises there would be no Cocles, his name would long since have passed
away, He might have been just as brave, to be aure, but without these
praises we should now have no such character iu om history, ior his name
would have been iorgotten

Such would be the connection of thought, unless Heusinger under·
stood that the general disposition to praise such conduct was the cause of
the bravery oi Cocles end the rest But this is improbable. Zumpt would
supply omnium ccrnmeroorctc‘crve celebrantur, which falls in with the spirit
ci the context—Declaratur caton . . . . qvod aarum quoque] etaim cleo,
not merely living meu. Steurenburg.
